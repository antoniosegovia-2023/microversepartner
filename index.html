        <h2 class="center">Some craziest thing that Schumacher does:</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li> <b>1969:</b> Michael Schumacher was born in the West German town of Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3
            January,
            to working-class parents Rolf—a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track—and Elisabeth Schumacher
            (1948–2003), who operated the track's canteen.</li>
          <li>1991: Schumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the 1991 Belgian Grand
            Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. Schumacher, still a
            contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1994:</b> Schumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994. The season, however, was marred by the
            death
            of Senna—witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind Senna—and the passing of Roland Ratzenberger
            during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly
            Schumacher's
            Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1995:</b> In 1995, Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton, which now had the same
            Renault
            engine as Williams; according to Motor Sport author Marcus Simmons, Benetton had the better team, while
            Williams had the superior car. Schumacher accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Hill.
          </li>
          <li><b>2000:</b> Schumacher won his third World Drivers' Championship in 2000, and his first with Ferrari,
            after a
            year-long battle with Häkkinen.
          </li>
          <li> <b>2001:</b> In 2001, Schumacher took his fourth Drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none
            sustained
            a season-long challenge for the championship.</li>
          <li> <b>2002:</b> In 2002, Schumacher retained his Drivers' Championship. There was some controversy, however,
            at the
            Austrian Grand Prix. His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was leading, but in the final metres of the race,
            under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.</li>
          <li><b>2003:</b> Schumacher broke Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers'
            title
            for the sixth time in 2003, after a closely contested battle with his main rivals.</li>
          <li><b>2004:</b> Schumacher won a record 12 of the first 13 races of the season, only failing to finish in
            Monaco
            after an accident with Montoya during a safety car period.</li>
          <li><b>2012:</b> In October 2012, Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time,[150] stating: "There
            were times
            in the past few months in which I didn't want to deal with Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix.He
            concluded the season with a seventh-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix; Schumacher placed 13th in the
            2012 Drivers' Championship.</li>
        </ul>
